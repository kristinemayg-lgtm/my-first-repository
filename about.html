    <th><ul><li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>

        <li> Add egg and vanilla. Add molasses and mix well.</li>
<li>Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and cayenne pepper. Mix just until combined to avoid over-mixing the dough.</li> 
<li>Fold in chocolate chunks.</li>
<li>Place sugar into a small bowl. Roll dough into small balls and roll into sugar, coating well. If you want the cookies to look like the ones in this recipe, place a few dark chocolate chunks on the top of the cookie before baking.</li>
